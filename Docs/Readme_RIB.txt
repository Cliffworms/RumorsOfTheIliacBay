==============
1. DESCRIPTION
==============

Rumors of the Iliac Bay adds 113 new rumors that can spread while asking a NPC about "Any news?".
They have a chance of showing up among the large pool of rumors currently spread.

The rumors come from other Elder Scrolls titles and RPGs and have been edited to fit
in Daggerfall's world.


===============
2. INSTALLATION
===============

Either install using Vortex Mod Manager or install manually as described below.


Extract the content of the archive to the StreamingAssets of your Daggerfall Unity directory.

Example : [Your drive]\DagUnity\DaggerfallUnity_Data\StreamingAssets

If you already have the "Cliff" folder, you can overwrite without issue.


=============
3. SAVE GAMES
=============

If you are loading Rumors of the Iliac Bay on an existing save game, you will need to open Daggerfall Unity's console
and type the following : 

StartQuest RIB


The quest adding the rumors will then be initiated.

The key to open the console can be found in the settings, under the "Advanced" tab in "Controls".

====================
4. UPDATING FROM 1.0
====================

If you have been using version 1.0 and you have visited the Isle of Balfiera or Orsinium, you may need to manually start
the quest that shows the rumors. This is because some locations referenced in the rumors cannot be found in these two
regions, which would prevent the quest from ever starting. If you are updating and you visited these regions, open
the console window and type the following : 

StartQuest RIB

If you have not visited these two regions, you do not need to do this step. 

=========================
5. CONFLICTS/KNOWN ERRORS
=========================

None known. Let me know if something's wrong.


==================
6. RUMORS EXAMPLES
==================

The Order of Arkay and the House of Dibella are in a constant fight for dominance in the Iliac Bay...many believe this will soon lead to open war.

Beggars are really becoming a problem in (city). They just won't take 'no' for an answer. Sure, this is (deity)'s city of love and charity. But sometimes I want to smack those whining pests.

Everyone knows who really runs (region). It's not the councilors. No one sits on that council unless it suits (ruler's name).

The good news is that this year's harvest looks as good as last year's.

You go out ta the wilds under that full moon, and youâ€™ll see that tower just appear. I was out there with mah dogs and they ran right into the dark. I lost my wineskin, too!

That (last name) fellow, he's a strange one. Always leaving town in the middle of the night and coming back in the morning. He thinks no one notices, but come on! With everyone so paranoid, it's impossible to go 'bout unnoticed.

7. LEGAL STUFF/DISCLAIMER
=========================

The mod may be distributed/translated without my authorization as long as I am credited as the author. Spread the love!
